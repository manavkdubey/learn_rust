# About
This repository is part of the Rust programming language course available at [zerotomastery.io](https://zerotomastery.io/). This repository (along with the lecture slides for this course) is available as a zip package [here](https://cdn.jayson.info/ztm/zerotomastery.io-rust.zip).

## Activities
To work on activities, open up your editor/IDE to the `activities` directory. The activities can can be ran by executing `cargo run --bin a1` in your terminal, where `a1` is the name of the activity file you are working on.

## ClipStash
To work on the ClipStash project, open up your editor/IDE to the `clipstash` directory. You will then be able to run `cargo check` to check your code, `cargo test` to test your code, or `cargo run --bin name` where `name` is the name of the binary you wish to run.

If you are getting compilation errors related to `rocket::response::content::Html` or `rocket::response::content::RawHtml` then run these commands to fix:

```
cargo update --package rocket --precise 0.5.0-rc.1
cargo update --package rocket_codegen --precise 0.5.0-rc.1
cargo update --package rocket_http --precise 0.5.0-rc.1
```

## Solutions
To view solutions for the activities, and for the ClipStash project, checkout the `solutions` branch by running `git checkout solutions` after cloning this repo.

### ClipStash
The ClipStash project requires additional steps in order to properly build. You will need the `sqlx-cli` tool which can be installed by running

```
cargo install sqlx-cli
```

After installing the tool, you can configure the database for the project by running

```
sqlx database setup
```
